# McJobs-miniproject
Our mini project focuses on the development of a web scraping application that utilizes Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Flask to collect job links from various websites.
Additionally, the project incorporates a resume builder feature to assist users in creating their resumes based on the job listings they discover.
The web scraping process combines the power of Selenium and Beautiful Soup. Selenium, a web automation tool, is employed to navigate and interact with dynamic
web pages, allowing the application to access job portals that require user interactions.
Beautiful Soup, a Python library for web scraping, is then utilized to extract relevant
data from the targeted websites.
The application, built using Flask, provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the web scraping functionalities. Users can specify their search criteria, such
as location, job type and the application will scrape job links from multiple websites
accordingly. The collected data is presented in a structured format within the web
app, enabling users to browse and explore the available job opportunities conveniently.
In addition to web scraping, the project incorporates a resume builder feature. Based
on the job listings discovered, the application provides a resume template and allows
users to input their relevant information. The resume builder streamlines the process
of creating tailored resumes for specific job applications, enhancing usersâ€™ chances of
securing employment.
By combining Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Flask, this mini project offers a comprehensive solution for job searching and resume building. It eliminates the need for
manual navigation through multiple job portals and provides a centralized platform
for collecting and exploring job links. The inclusion of the resume builder feature enhances the overall user experience by facilitating the creation of personalized resumes
based on the scraped job listings.
